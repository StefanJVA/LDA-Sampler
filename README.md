# LDA Samplers

This repository includes several **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** samplers implemented in **Java**.
The code should help to understand the different sampling algorithms.
It therefore sometimes favours readability over efficiency.

## How to run the project?
This project utilizes **Apache Ant** for automating the build process. 
Simply install **Apache Ant** and **Java** on your system.
You can now run the following commands in the project directory:

* `ant build` to build project (jar file),
* `ant run` to run the main method which executes a small sample,
* `ant doc` to generate a documentation,
* `ant clean` to clean up project folder.
